# Problem 1 - Washington Homicides

```{r}
homicide = read_csv("homicide-data.csv")
```
  The raw dataset contains `r ncol(homicide)` variables and `r nrow(homicide)` observations. Major variables contain: information about victims in each homicide, including their names, `r str_remove(colnames(homicide)[5:7], pattern = "victim_")`, and reported case information, such as `r colnames(homicide)[8:12]` and `r colnames(homicide)[2]`. 

```{r}

homicide %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, ",", state)
  ) %>%
  select(-city, -state)
